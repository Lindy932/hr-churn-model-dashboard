# Employee Churn Risk Prediction & Retention Insights  

## üìå Project Overview  
- This project is a pilot HR analytics initiative designed to predict employee turnover risk and provide HR teams with actionable insights to reduce attrition.
- It leverages Google BigQuery, Google Colab, PyCaret (Random Forest), and Looker Studio to answer critical HR questions and deliver insights through an interactive dashboard.

## ‚ùì Questions  

- Which employees are most at risk of quitting?  
- Which departments have the highest dissatisfaction and turnover risk?  
- What categories (e.g., salary, workload, lack of growth) contribute most to employee churn?  
- How can predictive analytics guide HR in building stronger retention strategies?

## üìÇ Workflow  

### 1. Data Collection  
- Queried employee HR data from **Google BigQuery**, including demographic, departmental, and performance information.  

### 2. Data Preparation  
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data within **Google Colab**.  
- Encoded categorical variables like **department**, **salary range**, and **job role**.  
- Handled missing values and standardized numerical features.  

### 3. Model Training  
- Built and compared multiple models using **PyCaret‚Äôs classification module**.  
- Selected **Random Forest** as the best-performing model based on **accuracy, F1 score, and ROC-AUC**.  
- Extracted **feature importance** to identify key drivers of turnover.
- Created a structured table with predicted employee attrition labels and corresponding risk scores

### 4. Insights & Analysis  
- Identified employees at **high risk of leaving**.  
- Highlighted **departments with elevated turnover risk**.  
- Determined top attrition drivers such as **salary dissatisfaction, workload, and limited career growth**.  
- Provided **employee-level risk scores** for targeted retention strategies.  

### 5. Dashboard Development  
- Created an **interactive Looker Studio dashboard** showing:  
  - Employee turnover risk distribution  
  - Department-wise attrition insights  
  - Key attrition drivers ranked by importance  
- Automated data flow from Python to Looker Studio using the **REST API**, ensuring up-to-date insights.
